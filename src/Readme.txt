General notes on design decisions and code organisation.

1. Given that this project was delivered as a finale to the sections
that introduced OO principles and practices I have decide to use
private class instance variables the processor and process classes and
provide access to these via discrete getter/setter mechanisms

2. Build a stage 1 branch to incorporate only the work from the
processor class. Then build a stage 2 branch to incorporate the work
on the process class. Merge these into a final submission.

3. I am _deeply_ hostile to the coding standards used in the base
code. In particular the method naming and private member
naming. I will reluctantly use these, but may also build branches that
fix this.
